<!-- the style tag allows you to style using CSS. everything that follows in the tag is using CSS formatting. adding style to the heading and using the div selector allows you to change the font (in this case) of all of the div selectors that folloe in this code. this means that the h1 and h3 headings below that are in closed in this div will habe the arial font. the rest of the file will have the OG fonts. Any section that uses the h3 tag will be red-->

		<h3><u> Research Proposal</u></h3>
		<div style="font-family: times new roman;">
<!-- This section is a breif summary of our proposal.-->
	
		<p> Biopharmaceuticals, like mAbs, are becoming the drug of choice for various illness like cancer. Studies are currently being conducted on using mAbs to treat Covid-19. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of amphiphilic protein. Due to this property, the protein can undergo conformational changes at hydrophobic interfaces like air/water or oil water/interfaces. These interfaces are present when drugs are administered using IV bags or syringes. Studies have been conducted using methods like UV spectroscopy, Nuclear reflection and CD; however, these methods aren't able to provide detailed information on the changes in the conformation. We would like to use 1D and 2D  NMR spectroscopy to study the structure of the mAbs in the bulk, and at a silicone oil interface. We then plan to add a surfactant, to see if that will resolve the issue of adsorption. We also plan to chemically denature mAbs to better compare the data.</p>

<!-- This section describes the most recent updates on the project.-->
		<p> I am in Dr. Hadi Mohammadigoshki's Lab at the FAMU-FSU College of Biological Sciences. This is the link to the groups research <a href="http://eng-web1.eng.famu.fsu.edu/~hadim64/Research.html">website</a>. We have worked with Dr. Brian Washburn and Dr. Carl Whittington at the FSU College of Biological Sciences to generate and purify the mAbs. We have begun some NMR experiments of the purified mAbs at the NHMFL using the 800MHz NMR spectrometer. We have run experiments on a bulk sample of the mAbs. We have also performed experiments on mAbs at a hydrophobic interface using silicone oil. Using a double pulsed field gradient spin echo (DPFGSE), we plan to locate the interface.  Below is an image showing the NMR spectra of the bulk mAbs sample (in red) and the sample near the interface (in blue) </p>
